Sup! I'm a Software Test Engineer at [IOHK](https://iohk.io) working on open source blockchain projects like [cardano](https://cardano.org/). You can see an example of my work [here](https://github.com/issoupadrink/cardano-rest-tests). Previously I was a software engineer at [Edplus](https://www.edtopia.io/) and [Oxford Computer Consultants](https://www.oxfordcc.co.uk/custom-software/), and a tech manager at [Apex-MT](https://apex-mt.com/).
