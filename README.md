Sup! I'm a Software Test Engineer at [Edge](https://edge.gg), a startup working on smart contracts for esports. You can see an example of my work [here](https://github.com/issoupadrink/cardano-rest-tests). Previously I was an SDET at [IOHK](https://iohk.io), software engineer at [Edplus](https://www.edtopia.io/) and [Oxford Computer Consultants](https://www.oxfordcc.co.uk/custom-software/), and a tech manager at [Apex-MT](https://apex-mt.com/).

:airplane: Moving to the Bay Area next year - [say hi](mailto:ohmyedd+github@gmail.com?subject=[Beer%20&%20Tech%20Chat!]) if you'd like to grab a beer and chat tech when I'm there! :beers:
